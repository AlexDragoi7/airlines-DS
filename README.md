# Airlines Data Science Project

The project will consist of different airline data sets, which can be used for API feed or data analytics purposes.

Data can be used in both JSON or CSV format (LibreOffice, OnlyOffice), so it can be further developed.

Technologies used:

    Python 3.10 - Web scraping, Data science and transformation
    SQL (SQLite)
    Node.js - server-side
    Python libraries (Seaborn, others) or Tableau / PowerBi - TBD
